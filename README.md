01) Using guided vanes to improve efficiency of VAWTs
        Design of the vane - Vane should increase the wind speed towards the rotor blades
        Design of the blade - Choosing the best blade configuration from existing designs/Designing a new blade which harnesses maximum energy
        Design of the stator - How many vanes, gap between vanes, radius of the stator, Vane density, material
        Design of the structure - How the supporting bars should be, Material, bearings etc.
